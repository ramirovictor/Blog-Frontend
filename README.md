# Development Server ðŸ’»

You can find the backend application code [here](https://github.com/ramirovictor/springblog-backend).

To run a development server:

1. Use the command:
```bash
ng serve

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
